        <p>
            I'm a senior Computer Science student. This semester, I would love to make a web portal 
            for my senior project, a wall mounted digital assistant designed to help dementia 
            patients and their caregivers manage daily life with less stress and confusion.
            
            Shortly after these photos were taken, my mom was diagnosed with a brain tumor that 
            has caused progressive cognitive decline, and she was diagnosed with dementia a year ago.
            I hadn't planned to build a web app as part of my senior project, but if we get to 
            choose our own, I would love to be able to enhance both projects with one.

        </p>

        <h2>Ideas for This Semester</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Settings Sync Dashboard</strong> — Allow caregivers to remotely access functionality and manage more in depth settings such as detailed user permissions for various family members.</li>
            <li><strong>Calendar Scheduling</strong> — More complex calendar settings, which sync to the patient's calendar.</li>
            <li><strong>Activity Dashboard</strong> — View medication compliance history and daily activity summaries collected by the household app.</li>
        </ul>
