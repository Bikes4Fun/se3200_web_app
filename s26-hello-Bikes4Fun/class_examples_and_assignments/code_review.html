In your post, briefly describe:
<br><br>
<b>What your page does. What API you used. What randomness you introduced.</b><br>
User Profile has a "Generate random user" button. It creates 3 random appointments and 3 random medications, shows them as cards. APIs: openFDA drug labels (meds), picsum.photos (card images). Random: titles, times, locations, drivers, schedules, dose choice.
<br><br>
<b>What was challenging</b><br>
Script load order so getCurrentUserProfile exists before the generator. openFDA labels sometimes missing data like dosage options or brand same as generic. Where to put "current user" so the rest of the app stays demo-agnostic. General file organizing and defining each ones purpose/scope (see AI).
<br><br>
<b>Anything you'd like specific feedback on</b><br>
Cool features I should add. This webapp matches my senior project which is NOT a web app and deciding what features to focus on has been a challenge. There is some broken functionality (session persistence and settings) but I'm not too worried about fixing those.
<br><br>
<b>How or where you used AI?</b><br>
Cursor Plan, Agent and Debug: planning, refactor/organizing, debugging, simplifying, comments, purpose/scope.

  <li><b>Functionality</b>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Does the page meet the project requirements?</b> Yes. DOM, random, JSON data, fetch, and it looks good.</li>
        <li><b>Anything missing?</b> No.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>DOM Interaction</b>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Can you identify where elements are selected and manipulated?</b> Yes. He uses querySelector and createElement for the card.</li>
        <li><b>Is the code easy to follow? Any improvements you'd suggest?</b> Yes. it was easy to follow. Nothing I'd change at this stage.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Events</b>
    <ul>
        <li><b>What DOM elements are being created? Where are they creating arrays or objects?</b> They make one card per shuffle and use arrays for the scores and filtered list. Each score is an object with title, composer, year, youtube id.</li>
        <li><b>Is it effective? Could it be improved?</b> Yes. the buttons and filter work and it re-shuffles when you type.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>HTML & CSS</b>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Does the page look professional and clean?</b> Yes. clear layout and easy to figure out how to use.</li>
        <li><b>Is the HTML semantic and well-structured?</b> Yes. header, main, section, article, labels, role="alert" on error.</li>
        <li><b>Any styling suggestions?</b> N/A.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>General Suggestions</b>
    <ul>
        <li><b>What's one thing you liked?</b> The filter and search work well, and having the YouTube links in JSON was smart.</li>
        <li><b>What's one idea or improvement you'd suggest?</b> Maybe run shuffle once when the page loads so you see a track right away instead of having to click first.</li>
    </ul>
