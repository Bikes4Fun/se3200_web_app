In your post, briefly describe:

<b>What your page does. What API you used. What randomness you introduced.</b>
User Profile has a "Generate random user" button. It creates 3 random appointments and 3 random medications, shows them as cards. APIs: openFDA drug labels (meds), picsum.photos (card images). Random: titles, times, locations, drivers, schedules, dose choice. 

<b>What was challenging</b>
Script load order so getCurrentUserProfile exists before the generator. openFDA labels sometimes missing data like dosage options or brand same as generic. Where to put "current user" so the rest of the app stays demo-agnostic. General file organizing and defining each ones purpose/scope (see AI).

<b>Anything you'd like specific feedback on</b>
Cool features I should add. This webapp matches my senior project which is NOT a web app and deciding what features to focus on has been a challenge. There is some broken functionality (session persistence and settings) but I'm not too worried about fixing those.

<b>How or where you used AI?</b>
Cursor Plan, Agent and Debug: planning, refactor/organizing, debugging, simplifying, comments, purpose/scope.
